	"prologueFadeIn": "You have been dreaming for a very long time.\n\nDreams of a green land, great cities, happy people.  Nothing but dreams of long ago.\nAnd now, you are waking up, and the dreams are fading...\n\nAnd in their place comes thin, fragile memory.\nOne memory remains clear.  There is a city nearby, one you used to call home.  Find it.\n\nReturn home."
